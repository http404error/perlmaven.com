Hello,

I'm writing a client on top of an API that uses Crypt::SSLeay to connect to a https site.
Could you please give some clarification on what this error message means, and further,
what typically causes this? I looked through your perldoc and did not see it documented.

Thank you for your time and assistance,
-Jiman

Yes, it means that you have to explicitly tell LWP::UserAgent not to verify hostnames
(if you need verification, you should use IO::Socket::SSL for now).


<code lang="perl">
my $ua  = LWP::UserAgent->new(
    ssl_opts => { verify_hostname => 0 },
);
