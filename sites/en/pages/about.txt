<h2>Who is the Perl Maven site for?</h2>

There are people who use Perl for tasks in <b>system administration</b> or in
<b>configuration management</b>.
<br />
Others build <b>web sites</b> or <b>web application</b> using Perl.
Yet others only need it for <b>small scripts</b>. Or so they were told.
Some people use Perl for <b>Bioinformatics</b> or for some other form of
<b>scientific calculations</b>.
There are a lot of people using Perl for <b>test automation</b>.
That's one of my favorite fields.

The Perl Maven web site was created for all of these people. It's aim is to
<b>help you get your job done</b>.

<b>Learning Perl</b> is a funny thing. On one hand, after a few hours of reading
you can already create small scripts and be productive. On the other hand, even after years
of using Perl daily you will still find new things. Either in the language or on CPAN.
The learning curve is flat, but long. Very long.

<h2>What is a Perl Maven?</h2>

According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maven">Wikipedia</a>:

<b>A maven is a trusted expert in a particular field, who seeks to pass knowledge on to others.</b>

My hope is that if you follow the articles of this site, read the books and watch the video lectures
you will constantly improve your Perl expertise. Soon you can <b>become a Perl Maven</b>.

The site contains lots of articles available free of charge,
several <a href="/perl-books">Perl books</a> and <a href="/perl-videos">video courses</a> for sale,
and the <a href="/pro">Perl Maven Pro</a> subscription with even more articles.

<h2>Versions of Perl</h2>

I am sure you are wondering what version of Perl is covered. For now we'll stick to Perl 5 and
publish the Perl 6 related articles on elsewhere. After all Perl 5 is what is used in production.
Within Perl 5 we try to be pragmatic. While it would be awesome to see more people move forward,
and use the newest releases of Perl, we have to be realistic. In many companies that's impossible.
We try to make sure the solutions can work on the perl 5.8 family, but
we point out when it is necessary to use a newer version of Perl.

You will see how using a newer version of Perl can improve your code, and you will also see how
to reach the point that you can use that version of Perl.
