<h2>Testing with Test::WWW::Mechanize::PSGI</h2>

<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::WWW::Mechanize::PSGI">Test::WWW::Mechanize::PSGI</a> is an excellent testing
library that makes it easy to create more complex interactions and to represent more than one browsers at the same time.
So you can observe that while one user (<hl>$mech1</hl>) sees the newly set text use two <hl>$mech2</hl> does not.
