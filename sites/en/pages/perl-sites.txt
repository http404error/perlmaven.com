=abstract start

It must be the age, or the lack of frequent use of some of the sites, but I keep forgetting some URLs.

I think I'd better collect here a bunch of URLs that are important for my use of Perl.

Some of them I use daily and thus I don't really need to remind myself, but can be useful for others to have.
Some others are heavily linked from MetaCPAN and that's how I get to them.

And then there are a few that I rarely use, but when I need them it would be handy to have them in one place.

=abstract end

<a href="http://metacpan.org/">MetaCPAN</a> the search engine I use to access the data on <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> itself.
(There is also <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">search.cpan.org</a>, but IMHO it should not be recommended any more. It should be
certainly clarified that there is nothing "official" with this site. Even though it is a subdomain of cpan.org it is still an independent site.)
I rarely find a reason to go to cpan.org, though the list <a href="http://www.cpan.org/src/README.html">most recent Perl releases</a> is quite useful.

<a href="http://blogs.perl.org/">blogs.perl.org</a> where quite a lot  of Perl developers write and discuss stuff.

<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/">Perl Monks</a> where we can ask questions and get good answers.

<a href="http://corelist.rpee.be/">Web::Module::CoreList</a> is a web interface to <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Module-CoreList">Module::CoreList</a>.
When you would like to know if a module comes with the core of perl, and specifically which version of the module came with which version of Perl. (*) 

<a href="http://perlybook.org/">Perly book</a> converting POD (Plain Old Documentation) to EPUB or MOBI. (No PDF yet.) (*)

<a href="http://prepan.org/">PrePAN</a> I think I've never used this site, but it can be a good place to discuss a new module idea. (Along with the 
<a href="http://lists.perl.org/list/module-authors.html">module-authors mailing list</a>.)

<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/">perldoc.perl.org</a> provides HTML version of the standard documentation though I prefer the one
on <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/perl">MetaCPAN</a>. I just wish the standard PODs were integrated into MetaCPAN better
so I would not need to send people to two sites for searching.

<a href="http://p3rl.org/">p3rl.org</a> is a link shortener for some Perl related pages. I don't think I have ever used it, but I know <a href="http://joel-berger.com">some</a> people who love it.

<a href="http://lists.perl.org/">List of all Perl-related mailing lists</a>. Or at least most of them.

<a href="http://pm.org/">Perl Mongers</a> list of the Perl Monger groups for when you visit a place, you can meet other Perl developers.

<a href="http://perlweekly.com/">Perl Weekly</a>, is one of the sites I publish together with Yanick Champoux
Once in a while I need to look up an article I remember was posted there. So I check it in the <a href="http://perlweekly.com/all.html">list of all the articles</a>.

<a href="https://perlmaven.com/">Perl Maven</a> another site I publish, but more and more frequently I need to use the search box at the top
to locate old articles.

<a href="http://perltricks.com/">Perltricks</a> written mostly by David Farrell has interesting and nicely formatted articles. This is the only other site I am aware
of (besides the Perl Maven site you are reading) where the author actually expressed a  desire to bring in more readers.

<a href="http://www.learning-perl.com/">Learning Perl</a>,<br>
<a href="http://www.effectiveperlprogramming.com/">Effective Perl Programming</a>,<br>
<a href="http://www.masteringperl.org/">Mastering Perl</a>,<br> 
and <a href="http://www.programmingperl.org/">Programming Perl</a>, the sites maintained by brian d foy and branded to the respective books he wrote,
are useful for keeping up with new Perl features, as well as reading deeply analyzes about some existing functionality.

<a href="http://mapofcpan.org/">Map of CPAN</a> Namespaces as tiles.

<h2>Specialized sites</h2>

<a href="http://cpxxxan.barnyard.co.uk/">cpXXXan</a> snapshots of CPAN for specific versions of Perl.

<a href="http://cpancover.com/">CPAN Cover</a> - test coverage report of a number of CPAN modules generated by <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::Cover">Devel::Cover</a>.

<!--
<a href="http://www.perlcritic.com/">Perl Critic</a> - 
-->

<a href="http://cpan.io/">cpan.io</a> is a new site. I have no idea how well it will work out.

<a href="http://cpantesters.org/">CPAN Testers</a> while it is "heavily linked" from MetaCPAN, and I visit it quite often (so I don't think
I'll forget the URL) but it might be worth mentioning separately as it has plenty of "subsites" with all kinds of extra information.

<a href="http://cpants.cpanauthors.org/">CPANTS</a> provides "Kwalitee" metric for CPAN modules. (*)

<a href="http://changes.cpanhq.org/">Changes CPAN HQ</a> checks if the Changes file supplied in the distribution is according to the spec. (*)

<h2>Other</h2>

<a href="http://perl.org/">perl.org</a> is called the "home of perl", but I rarely find a reason to go there.

Once in a while <a href="http://perlnews.org/">perlnews.org</a> posts some news article, but unfortunately it could not gain a prominent status as the announcements on use.perl.org had.

I don't need the main site of <a href="http://perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a> too often, but I follow the news feed on <a href="http://news.perlfoundation.org/">their blog</a>.

The <a href="http://www.builtinperl.com/">Built in Perl</a> is a nice looking site that shows a number of companies and personal projects built using Perl.
I don't frequently visit it but if you try to prove someone that others are also using Perl, this might help.

<a href="http://perlbuzz.com/">Perlbuzz</a> is mostly a <a href="https://twitter.com/perlbuzz">Twitter feed</a> with Perl related news items that are then collected
into a weekly blog-post.

The <a href="http://perltraining.com.au/tips/">Perl Tips</a> of Perl Training Australia is a collection of some very good Perl-related articles. There is also
a newsletter so you won't miss a newly published article.

<a href="http://www.perlrdf.org/">Perl and RDF</a>

<a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/">Template Toolkit</a>

<a href="http://mojolicio.us/">Mojolicious</a>

<a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/">Catalyst</a>

<a href="http://perldancer.org/">Perl Dancer</a>

<a href="http://plackperl.org/">PSGI/Plack</a>

<a href="http://cpanmin.us/">CPAN Minus</a> (redirects to GitHub)

<a href="http://perlbrew.pl/">Perlbrew</a>

<h2>Perl 6</h2>

Once in a while, when I have time, I look at <a href="http://perl6.org/">Perl 6</a> and at <a href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo</a>, but unfortunately I rarely have time for these.



(*) I think these sites should be (better) integrated into MetaCPAN.
