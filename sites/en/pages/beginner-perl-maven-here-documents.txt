Here documents

A gotcha: The <hl>END_STRING</hl> we have put at the end of the string must be exactly the same as we have at the beginning.
You can't even have extra whitespaces! So make sure the <hl>END_STRING</hl> at the end of the here document starts at the first character of the line and has no spaces,
tabs, or other invisible characters at the end of the line.
