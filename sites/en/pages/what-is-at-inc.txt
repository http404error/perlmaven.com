=abstract start

<hl>@INC</hl> is a built-in array perl provides. It contains a series of directories, the "search path" for perl when trying to load a module.

=abstract end

When perl encounters a <hl>use</hl> statement, a <hl>require</hl> statement, or a <hl>do</hl> statement:

<code lang="perl">
use Module::Name;
</code>

<code lang="perl">
require Module::Name;
</code>

<code lang="perl">
do "Module/Name.pm";
</code>


perl will go over the directories listed in <hl>@INC</hl> and check if the appropriate file can be found.

In our example, if we try to load <hl>Module::Name</hl>. Perl will check if there is a <hl>Module</hl> subdirectory in any of
of the directories with a file called <hl>Name.pm</hl> in the directory.

perl will load the first such file.

<h2>Content of @INC</h2>

The content of <hl>@INC</hl> is baked into your version of perl when perl itself was installed and it differs
based on the version of perl and your operating system.
You can however change it in a number of ways via the <hl>PERLLIB</hl> and <hl>PERL5LIB</hl> environment variables,
using the <hl>-I</hl> command line flag, or inside the code by manipulating <hl>@INC</hl> directly.

Search for <a href="https://perlmaven.com/search/@INC">@INC</a> and you'll find your
