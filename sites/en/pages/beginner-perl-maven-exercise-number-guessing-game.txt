Create a simple command line game guessing a whole number.

<ul>
  <li>Let the computer "think" about a whole number between 1-200 using the rand() function.</li>
  <li>Let the user guess a number.</li>
  <li>Tell the user if his guess was bigger or smaller than the number the computer "thought" of or tell him if he hit the right number.</li>
  <li>At this point the user only has one guess, though as a bounus you can allow the user to guess several times.</li>
</ul>
