Exercise: improve the color selector

=abstract end


There are several parts of this exercise:

<ul>
  <li>Currently the color selector shows menu items numbered from 0. Change it so the displayed numbers will start at 1 but that it will still work correctly.</li>
  <li>Currently the user can give any value on the command line. Incluing "nonsense". Check that the given value
      is indeed one of the possible values hard-coded in the script. Report an error and quit if it isn't.</li>
  <li>Allow the user to supply a flag called --force If this flag is present allow any value as a color. Even "nonsense".</li>
  <li>Read the names of the valid colors from the colors.txt file.</li>
  <li>Allow the user to supply a --file flag as in "--file mycolor.txt" and take the name of the file with the colors from there.</li>
</ul>
