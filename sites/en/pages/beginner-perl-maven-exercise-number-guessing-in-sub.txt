Exercise: number guessing in sub

=abstract end

Take the solution of the improved number guessing game from examples/arrays/number_guessing.pl and change it so some parts of it will be functions.

Specifically you can create subs for

<ul>
  <li>the moving of the spaceship</li>
  <li>checking the hit</li>
</ul>

How would you indicate the need to 'last' from within the function?
