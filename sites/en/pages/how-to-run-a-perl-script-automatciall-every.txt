Scheduling perl scripts to run at a certain time, or at a certain interval is usually done by some service of
the operating system. In Unix/Linux/Mac OSX this can be crontab, and we call the processes <hl>cron-jobs</hl>.

On Windows there is a service called scheduler that will do the work.

<h2>Linux/Unix/Mac OSX</h2>

The crontab on Linux/Unix/Mac OSX can be configured by editing a text file with a special command.

Each line in the file is a scheduled job.
Empty lines and lines starting with <hl>#</hl> are disregarded:

The other lines contain 6 values. The first five represent the schedule in the following order:
minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week.

The 6th is the actual command.

* at any of the first five slots mean "every" so a * at the first slot means "every minute".

The following crontab will run every minute:

<code>
# m h  dom mon dow   command
* * * * * /home/gabor/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.18.2/bin/perl /home/gabor/bin/ts.pl >> /home/gabor/ts.out
</code>

<h2>How to run a Perl script automatically every 12pm</h2>

The following crontab will run every day at 12 hour 0 minutes.

<code>
# m h  dom mon dow   command
0 12 * * * /home/gabor/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.18.2/bin/perl /home/gabor/bin/ts.pl >> /home/gabor/ts.out
</code>

Every user in a Unix/Linux system has her own crontab.  <hl>crontab -l</hl> will list the crontab file of the
current user. You can prepare a text file (e.g. crontab.txt) describing your cron-jobs with any editor and then load them
using <hl>crontab path/to/crontab.txt</hl>. I usually keep that text file under version-control.

Every hour +0, +20, and +40 minutes:

<code>
0,20,40 * * * * command
</code>

Every 2 minutes:

<code>
*/2 * * * * command
</code>

<h2>MS Windows</h2>

MS Windows has a service called
