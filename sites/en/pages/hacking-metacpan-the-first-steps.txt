CPAN, the <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">Comprehensive Perl Archive Network</a> has two
main front-ends. The old <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">search.cpan.org</a> for which the source code is not available publicly, and <a href="https://metacpan.org/">Meta CPAN</a>,
that is open source and has a nice public API.

I think it is great that we can make changes and improvements to Meta::CPAN.

Let's see how can we start doing it.

=abstract end

(Disclaimer: I tried it on Linux and Mac OSX using
<a href="http://perlbrew.pl/">perlbrew-ed</a> Perl 5.18.1,
I don't know if this will work on Windows or not.)
The <a href="https://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-web">README</a> indicates
that is works on Win32 as well.

MetaCPAN has two main parts: 
<ol>
<li>The back-end that collects and processes all the data and provides and API.</li>
<li>The front end that talks to this API and displays the data.</li>
</ol>

In this article we'll see how to set up a copy of the front end and how
to make a small change to it.

Clone the <a href="https://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-web">metacpan-web</a>
repository from GitHub.

<code>
$ git clone https://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-web.git
</code>

(Note: If you want to contribute your changes back then you'll probably first
want to fork the repository and clone the forked version.)

If you don't have it yet, install <a href="http://cpanmin.us">cpan-minus</a>.
This is not a requirement, but it will make
<a href="http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/1528/five-ways-to-install-modules-prereqs-by-hand/">installation of the dependencies</a> easier.

<code>
$ cd metacpan-web
$ cpanm --installdeps .
</code>

Then check if everything was installed:

<code>
$ perl Makefile.PL
</code>

One thing I noticed is that <hl>cpanm --installdeps .</hl>  did not upgrade JSON and JSON::XS. I have 2.61 instead of 2.90, and 2.34 instead of 3.01 respectively. So I installed
them manually:

<code>
$ cpanm JSON
$ cpanm JSON::XS
</code>


Run the tests that come with the code:

<code>
$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test
</code>

Then following the <a href="https://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-web">README</a> launch
the web site using

<code>
$ plackup -p 5001 -r
</code>

This will start a MetaCPAN front end on port 5001 and <hl>-r</hl> will reload
the application whenever a file changes. This is really good during development.


Now you can visit <a href="http://localhost:5001">localhost:5001</a> and voil√†,
you have your own Meta::CPAN.

Try using it to make sure everything works and that it can connect to the
back-end server.

<h2>Adding links to Google+</h2>

If you "connect" a web page with your Google+ account, Google will display
your face whenever that page appears in a search on Google itself.
This needs two steps, one of them is that each page will link to the
Google+ profile of the author with <hl>?rel=author</hl> at the end of the URL.

This is what I wanted to add. 

After some searching, I found out that the templates of MetaCPAN are in
the
<a href="https://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-web/tree/master/root">root</a> subdirectory.

I thought I'd like to add the link to Google+ under the picture of the module author
on the right-hand side. (See for example <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/SVG">SVG</a>, one of the modules I currently maintain.)

I found out that this part of the pages is included from the 
<a href="https://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-web/blob/master/root/inc/author-pic.html">root/inc/author-pic.html</a>. As the rest of the site, this is also using
<a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/">Template Toolkit</a>.

Ever user of MetaCPAN has a profile, and in that profile they can list their IDs on various other sites. Each such other site has a name and an ID string. Basically a key-value pair.
The key for Google+ is <b>googleplus</b> and thus I added the following entry:

<code>
<% IF p.name == "googleplus" %>
  <a rel="author" href="<% profiles.${p.name}.url.replace('%s', p.id) %>?rel=author" target="_blank" title="<% p.name %> - <% p.id%>">
    <img src="/static/images/profile/<% p.name %>.png" width=16 height=16 alt="<% p.name %>">
  </a>
<% END %>
</code>

This <a href="http://www.template-toolkit.org/">Template Toolkit</a> code means
that when the profile name is "googleplus" add a link with an img.

The snippet was based on the code in the <a href="https://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-web/blob/master/root/author.html"">root/author.html</a> file that displays lots of profile-icons
on the left-hand side of the individual <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/SZABGAB">author pages</a>. At least for people who added the profiles to their
<a href="https://metacpan.org/account/profile">MetaCPAN account</a>.

<h2>Linking from Google+ to MetaCPAN</h2>

The other side of the "connection" was described in my post calling
the CPAN authors to
<a href="https://szabgab.com/claiming-your-cpan-authorship-at-google.html">connect their Google+ pages to MetaCPAN</a>.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

It is very easy to set up a local version of the MetaCPAN front-end and to start
making changes to it. Go ahead, make some changes, send a pull request and see
your name appear among the <a href="https://metacpan.org/about/contributors">contributors</a>.

There are currently 85 contributors.

My objective is to make it in the first 3 rows before the end of the year.
Can you stop me from reaching that?


<h2>ps</h2>

At first I had to count the number of contributors manually,
but then I checked the source code of that page. It is located in
<a href="https://github.com/CPAN-API/metacpan-web/blob/master/root/about/contributors.html">root/about/contributors.html</a> and it is using <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>
with an Ajax call. So I added two lines to also display the total number of contributors.
Even if it is not accepted by the maintainers of MetaCPAN, I can now check the number
on my own copy of the MetaCPAN site.

I really enjoy the fact that I can change MetaCPAN so easily.
