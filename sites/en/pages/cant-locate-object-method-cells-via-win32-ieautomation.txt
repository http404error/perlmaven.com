Hello, I m using Win32::IEAutomation package from CPAN on Windows platform. I m trying to find out the text on the table using cells function.

<code lang="perl">
$ie->getTable("id:", "rt_NS");
print "\n$ie";
 my $third_cell = $ie->cells(1);
print "\n$third_cell";
$text = $third_cell->cellText;
print "\ntext=$text";
</code>

But I m getting above mentioned error. Please let me know which exactly package consists of Cells method which is referred on CPAN IE automation website.

"cells" is a method from the Win32::IEAutomation::Table class. Your code should look like

<code lang="perl">
my $table = $ie-&gt;getTable("id:", "rt_NS");
print "\n$ie";

my $third_cell = $table-&gt;cells(1);
print "\n$third_cell";

$text = $third_cell-&gt;cellText;
print "\ntext=$text";
</code>
