In the Python world it is quite straight forward to make files work either as executables or as modules.
In Perl it is a bit strange, but doable.

brian d foy has written a number of <a href="https://www.masteringperl.org/category/chapters/modulinos/">articles about Modulinos</a>,
but in nutshell a Modulino is a Perl file that can act both as an executable (a script that you would invoke directly)
or as a module (Something you load into memory and expect to execute code only when you call one of its functions or
methods).

=abstract end

The way to implement this in Perl is to put every executable code inside function and leave only the following statement in the main body of your code:

<code lang="perl">
main() if not caller();
</code>

assuming you have a function called <hl>main</hl> that implements the behavior you'd want to see when the file is
executed as a stand-alone script.

Here is an example to demonstrate the concept:

<include file="examples/modulino.pm">

If we run it as a script we will have the following output:

<code>
$ perl modulino.pm
Hello from main() of modulino.pl
</code>

If we load it as a module, it will generate no output:

<code>
$ perl -Mmodulino -e1
</code>

that's because it will not execute the <hl>main()</hl> function.

However, we can use its functions:

<code>
$ perl -Mmodulino -e"main()"
Hello from main() of modulino.pl
</code>

We can also use it inside another script:

<include file="examples/modulino_user.pl">

<code>
$ perl modulino_user.pl
Hello from main() of modulino.pl
</code>

<h2>What is this caller ?</h2>

To quote from its documentation:

<q>The caller function of Perl returns the context of the current pure perl subroutine call.
In scalar context, returns the caller's package name if there is a caller 
(that is, if we're in a subroutine or "eval" or "require") and the undefined value otherwise.</q>

In other words, when we execute the file directly <hl>caller</hl> returns <hl>undef</hl>, but when
we load it with a <hl>use</hl> statement (which is just a wrapper around <hl>require</hl>) then
it will have some value other than undef. Something <a href="/boolean-values-in-perl">true</a>.

The <hl>caller</hl> function has other uses as well, but for our purposes this is what we need to know about it.

<h2>Modulino with print</h2>

In case you'd like to look at another example to see how this works check out this one:

<include file="examples/modulino_with_print.pm">

Here we have an extra print-statement in the main body of the file.

When executing directly we see both lines:

<code>
$ perl modulino_with_print.pm
Hello from the body of modulino.pl
Hello from main() of modulino.pl
</code>

When loaded as a module, only the one in the body of the file is executed.

<code>
$ perl -Mmodulino_with_print  -e1
Hello from the body of modulino.pl
</code>

BTW, that's one of the reasons it is not recommended to put any code outside of functions. Especially not in modules.

<h2>Modulino in a package</h2>

To show yet another case, here we can see that we can use the same trick in a namespace as well:

<include file="examples/MyModulino.pm">

In this case we have our code inside a <a href="/search/package">package</a>.
This is how the output looks like if we try to run it directly:

<code>
$ perl MyModulino.pm

Hello from main() of modulino.pl
</code>

We can create a script using the module:

<include file="examples/use_my_modulino.pl">

And this is its output if we run the script:

<code>
$ perl use_my_modulino.pl

before
Hello from main() of modulino.pl
after
</code>

If we did not call <hl>MyModulino::hi();</hl> we would only see the "before" and "after" lines.
