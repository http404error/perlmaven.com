=abstract start

The <hl>Changes</hl> and <hl>README</hl> files are two free-form files, though the the <hl>Changes</hl> files
usually have a common form. Recently work has been done to
create a <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Changes::Spec">specification for the Changes file</a>.

<slidecast file="/media/videos/advanced-perl/libraries-and-modules/changes-and-readme" youtube="tlrm0Zm3Lr8" />

Even the name of the Changes file is not standardizd. Some people write <hl>CHANGES</hl>,
others write <hl>Changes</hl>, yet others write <hl>ChangeLog</hl>.

It usualy includes entries for each release with the version number and date of release,
and then a list of major changes. Sometime indicating the bug number that were fixed or
the person who sent in those changes.

The README file used to be important before CPAN had a web interface, today it
is quite unclear what should be in it.
