=abstract start

Given two (or more) hashes, where each value is a reference to an array how can we merge them?

Two solutions.



=abstract end

<h2>Merge including duplicate values</h2>

In the first one we just merge the arrays. Duplicate values remain.

<h2>Merge excluding value duplication - ensuring values are unique</h2>

In the second we only keep distinct values withine each array.

As you can see if one of the original arrays had a duplicate value (Jack in semester one had two 1-s)
those will be also subject for the unification.
