It seems quite a few people who are probably new to Perl want to install the PadWalker module.
Probably in order to use it with the EPIC plugin of Eclipse.

The installation should be simple but when you are new to Perl you
probably don't know how to do it.

So depending on what Operating System and which Perl distribution
you have, let's see the instructions:

=abstract end

<h2>Strawberry Perl or DWIM Perl on Windows</h2>

Both <a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a>,
and its derivative <a href="http://dwimperl.szabgab.com/">DWIM Perl for Windows</a>
come with an already configured cpan client.

Open the Command Window (Start -> Run -> type in cmd) When you get the "DOS" prompt
type in <hl>cpan PadWalker</hl>.
Please note, module names are case sensitive,
so typing <hl>cpan padwalker</hl> or <hl>cpan Padwalker</hl>
will <b>not</b> work!

<code>
c:> cpan PadWalker
</code>


<h2>ActivePerl</h2>

There is a graphical tool for this as well, but it might be more simple just to open the
Command Window (Start -> Run -> type cmd). When you get the "DOS" prompt, type in
<hl>ppm install PadWalker</hl>. Please note, this is case sensitive!

<code>
c:> ppm install PadWalker
</code>


<h2>Debian/Ubuntu Linux</h2>

If you have <b>root</b> rights then probably the best is to install
from the package management system of your Linux distribution.

You can use either <hl>aptitude</hl> or <hl>apt-get</hl>
depending on your persona preferences:

<code>
$ sudo apt-get install libpadwalker-perl
</code>

<code>
$ sudo aptitude install libpadwalker-perl
</code>

Alternatively, you can follow the instructions with <b>cpanm</b> below.

<h2>RedHat/CentOS Linux</h2>

Using the package management system:

<code>
$ sudo yum install PadWalker
</code>

Alternatively, you can follow the instructions with <b>cpanm</b> below.


<h2>Mac OSX</h2>

Follow the instructions with <b>cpanm</b> below.


<h2>Using cpanm</h2>

This is for Linux and OSX systems:

First, if you don't have it installed yet,
then install <a href="http://cpanmin.us">cpan minus</a> by typing

<code>
$ \curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - App::cpanminus
</code>

Once it is installed type:

<code>
$ cpanm PadWalker
</code>
