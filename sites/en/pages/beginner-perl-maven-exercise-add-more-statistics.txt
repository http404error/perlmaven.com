Exercise: add more statistics

=abstract end

Take the script from the <a href="/beginner-perl-maven-sum-numbers-in-a-file">count sum</a> example where we added up the numbers in each row of a file and add additional statistical values:

minumum

maximum

average

median and standard deviation are probably too difficult at this point.
