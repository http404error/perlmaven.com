Exercise number

=abstract end

Write a function that given a string it return true if the string is a number. As there might be several definitions of what is the number create several solutions one for each definition:

<ul>
  <li>Non negative integer.</li>
  <li>Integer. (Will you also allow + in front of the number or only - ?</li>
  <li>Real number. (Do you allow .3 ? What about 2. ?</li>
  <li>In scientific notation. (something like this: 2.123e4 )</li>
</ul>
