Perl provides some basic tools upon which user can build various object oriented systems.
On this page you'll find information on the most commonly used "hash-based" object system
with Perl with some helper modules.

<a href="/moo">Moo</a> and <a href="/moose">Moose</a> are two other hash-based object systems that are mostly compatble
with this, but provide lots of extra features that if we wanted, we would need to create ourselves in
the classic Perl OOP described on this page.

<h2>Class declaration</h2>

A class is just a <hl>namespace</hl> created using the <hl>package</hl> keyword.
It is usually implemented in a module having the same name. For example the class
<hl>My::Date</hl> would be implemented in a file called <hl>Date.pm</hl> located in a directory called
<hl>My</hl> having the following content:

<code lang="perl">
package My::Date;
use strict;
use warnings;


1;
</code>

The <hl>1;</hl> at the end is needed to indicate successful loading of the file.

This code isn't really a class without a constructor.

<h2>Constructor</h2>

While <hl>new</hl> is not a reserved word in Perl, most people implement the constructor as the
<hl>new</hl> method.

<code lang="perl">
sub new {
    my ($class, %args) = @_;
    return bless \%args, $class;
}
</code>


<h2>Instance / Object</h2>

An instance or object is a <hl>blessed reference</hl>. In the most common case, as described in this article,
it is a <hl>blessed reference to a hash</hl>


<h2>Destructor</h2>

Perl automatically cleans-up objects when they go out of scope, or when the program ends and usually there is no
need to implement a destructor. With that said, there is a special function called <hl>DESTROY</hl>.
If it is implemented, it will be called just before the object is destroyed and memory reclaimed by Perl.

<code lang="perl">
sub DESTROY {
   my ($self) = @_;
   ...
}
</code>

<h2>Inheritance</h2>

You can declare inheritance using the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/parent">parent</a> directive
which replaced the older <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/base">base</a> directive. In the end they
are both just manipulating the <hl>@ISA</hl> array that defines the inheritance.

The main script loads a module, calls its constructor and then calls two methods on it:

<include file="examples/oop/inheritance1/main.pl">

The module itself declares its inheritance using the <hl>parent</hl> directive.

<include file="examples/oop/inheritance1/MyModule.pm">

The module from where we inherit, declares the constructor and another method.

<include file="examples/oop/inheritance1/MyParent.pm">

When we call the <hl>new</hl> method on "MyModule" Perl will see that MyModule does not
have a 'new' function and it will look at at the next module in the <b>inheritance chain</b>.
In this case it will look at the <hl>MyParent</hl> module and call <hl>new</hl> there.

The same will happen when we call <hl>say_hi</hl>.

On the other hand when we call <hl>say_hello</hl> perl will already find it in the
<hl>MyModule</hl> and call it.

Instead of the <hl>parent</hl> directive, old school code uses the <hl>base</hl> directive:

<code>
use base 'MyParent';
</code>

If you are interested in the fully manual process (you should probably never do this),
then you can add the parent module to the <hl>@ISA</hl> array directly, but then you also
need to load the module yourself.

<code>
use MyParent;
our @ISA = ('MyParent');
</code>


One side note. Never ever call your module "Parent.pm" or "Base.pm". That will break your code
when you try to run it on an operating system with case insensitive filesystem such as MS Windows
or Apple Mac OSX. I know. I fell in that trap while preparing this example.
