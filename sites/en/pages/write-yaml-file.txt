<a href="/yaml">YAML</a> is primarily used as a configuration file that people write and the program reads, but it can
be used for <a href="/data-serialization-in-perl">data serialization</a> as well. In addition, especially when writing
tests, there are other cases as well when we would like to save a data structure as a YAML file.

<include file="examples/save_yaml.pl">

The result will look like this:
